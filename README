**** INTRO ****

Welcome to ABBOV - A Blog Based On Visitors!

On this document you will learn what you need to run ABBOV, how to setup it and where to find extra information.

**** REQUIREMENTS ****

To run ABBOV, you'll need to have a working installation of the following servers and languages:

* Apache (>= 2)
* PHP (>= 5.3)
* MySQL (>= 5)

ABBOV uses the older mysql API (not the mysqli one). We cannot guarantee that it will work beyond version 5.5.21 because at any time the mysql interface can be removed.

While ABBOV may run on older versions of Apache, PHP and MySQL, it is not recommended on those older versions and it won't be supported by our developers.

ABBOV is a fairly simple engine and doesn't require a lot of hardware resources.

**** SETUP ****

First of all, edit the settings/globalvars.php with the values for your MySQL server. The description of the fields is the following:

$GLOB_username is the username that ABBOV will use to access your MySQL server.
$GLOB_password is the password for the username in $GLOB_username.
$GLOB_server is the MySQL server where ABBOV will be stored address.
$GLOB_database is the name of the database in the MySQL server. For a default installation leave it as it is.
$GLOB_folder is the folder where ABBOV will be running in your web server. If your address is something like http://yourdomain.com/, the value is the default one ("/"). If it is something like http://yourdomain.com/blog/, the value should be "/blog/".

In order for ABBOV to work, we recommend to run the provided installation script, install.php, to create the database and tables in your MySQL server. If you do prefer to create the structures, please refer to our MySQLTables wiki page in the project's website.

**** SUPPORT ****

ABBOV's support is provided by our Google Code page. There, you'll find our wiki, where there will be support information like FAQ's, and the Issues system where you can leave your suggestions, bugs or problems.

**** DEVELOP ****

ABBOV is a blog engine and not a blogging platform. Therefore you won't be able to do anything in a browser with only ABBOV.

It's mandatory to use the provided APIs to display information on ABBOV. The developer documents are available for download as a separate package in the Downloads section of our Google Code page.

**** SVN REPOSITORY ****

ABBOV has a public SVN repository where you can find the latest stage of development, most of the times more advanced that the current release.

If you want to download ABBOV from the SVN repository just follow the instructions in our Source page.
