ABBOV is a blog engine designed from the ground up with simplicity and flexibility in mind. ABBOV stands for A Blog Based On Visitors.

As the name suggests, we use the Visitor design pattern to display content stored on a MySQL database. This gives us extreme flexibility since you can build your own visitors (as long as they implement the Visitor interface) and display information as you want. You are no longer stuck to the model the developer chose to design your blog. It's your blog, have it your way.

The project is still in it's early development stages and it's not for deployment. Unless you want a blog that only supports unformatted text and all posts must be "built" from a MySQL interface. Otherwise, if you're looking for a blogging platform to deploy, stay away from this.

**PROJECT STATUS (_26/05/2012_)**

I know I promised to deliver the first Developer Preview of ABBOV in the first weeks of March and failed that deadline. Unfortunately for this project, I had to devote my time to my studies and college works and leave it suspended for the time.

I hope I can go back to update ABBOV in mid-June, as soon as I can, and begin implementing new features on the engine. Until then, the latest version is Pre-Developer Preview 4 or the code in the svn rep.

I am sorry for not being able to release the Developer Preview on time and not informing you about what was happening.
